The Gene Function Classifier is an intelligent machine learning–based bioinformatics web application built using Streamlit, designed to predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms directly from DNA or protein sequences. It allows users to either paste a raw sequence or upload a FASTA file, and then automatically predicts the top three probable GO terms along with their confidence scores. The project demonstrates the integration of computational biology and artificial intelligence, showing how machine learning can assist in gene function annotation. The underlying model is a Random Forest Classifier developed using scikit-learn, trained on a synthetic dataset of 500 randomly generated sequences stored in go_subset.csv. Each sequence is characterized by its base composition (A, T, G, C frequencies) and GC content, which serve as numerical features for classification. The resulting trained model (trained_model.pkl) and label encoder (label_encoder.pkl) are stored for real-time prediction through the web interface. The app’s frontend is implemented in Streamlit, providing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface with a sidebar navigation panel for Home, Prediction, and About sections. Users can input DNA or protein sequences, click “Predict GO Terms,” and instantly view the predicted GO IDs with corresponding confidence levels and short term descriptions. The web application is lightweight, portable, and deployable on Streamlit Cloud, requiring only Python and essential packages like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and biopython. The repository contains the main application script (app.py), the model training script (model_training.py), the dataset (go_subset.csv), model files, and requirements.txt for deployment dependencies. The workflow involves first training the model locally using python model_training.py, then running the app via streamlit run app.py, which launches a local web server accessible at http://localhost:8501. Once tested, the repository can be uploaded to GitHub and directly deployed to Streamlit Cloud by linking it to the repository and setting app.py as the main entry file. In terms of technical stack, the application combines Python-based data processing and model inference with a modern web interface, providing a foundation for future extensions such as integration with UniProt/GOA databases, inclusion of protein-level descriptors (AAC, DPC), or multi-label GO prediction for complex biological roles. This project highlights how computational tools can automate biological data interpretation and bridge the gap between sequence-level data and functional insights. Developed by Sanyukta Kapara, this project is part of an initiative to build accessible and educational tools for computational biology, focusing on the use of AI and machine learning to streamline gene annotation and biological research.
